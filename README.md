# Continuity

Continuity is a quiet interface for capturing thoughts that feel important —  
without forcing permanence.

Most digital tools optimize for retention.
Continuity explores the opposite:
**what we choose to carry forward, and what we allow to fade.**

---

## What it does

- Lets you write a thought in the moment
- Saves it locally, privately, without accounts
- Resurfaces past thoughts at random
- Allows intentional decisions:
  - *Still matters*
  - *Not anymore*
- Uses impermanence as a design feature, not a flaw

All data lives in the browser.
Nothing is uploaded. Nothing is tracked.

---

## Why it exists

Memory is not a database.
Meaning is not linear.

Continuity is an experiment in designing software
that respects uncertainty, emotional weight,
and the human tendency to forget — selectively.

---

## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Browser `localStorage`

No frameworks. No backend. No surveillance.

---

## Running locally

Just open `index.html` in a browser.

Or deploy instantly using:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Any static host

---

## Status

This project is an evolving prototype.
The interface is intentionally minimal.
The behavior is intentionally incomplete.

That incompleteness is part of the design.
